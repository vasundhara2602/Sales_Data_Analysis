# Sales_Data_Analysis
In this project we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

We start by cleaning our data.
	1.Drop NaN values from DataFrame
	2.Removing rows based on a condition
	3.Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Once the data have been cleaned up, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

	1.What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
	2.What city sold the most product?
	3.What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
	4.What products are most often sold together?
	5.What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. Concatenated multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame. Adding new columns we might require for our data analysis and exploration. Added graphs and charts wherever necessary for easy understanding of insights.
